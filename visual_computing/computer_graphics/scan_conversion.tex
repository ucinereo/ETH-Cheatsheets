\section{Scan Conversion (Rasterization)}

Approximation of a primitive by a finit number of pixels.

\begin{algorithm}[Bresenham Line]
  Fast decision which pixel has to be drawn next.
  \textit{Criterion}: Position of midpoint \(m\) to intersection \(q\).
  Consider the line equation: \(f(x, y) = ax + by + c = 0\): 

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \(d = f(m) = f(x_p + 1, y_p + 1/2) > 0 \implies\) NE, else E
    \item NE \(\implies d_{new} = d_{old} + \Delta y - \Delta x\), else \(d_{new} = d_{old}+ \Delta y\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{theorem}
  For polygons an inside test for each px is too inefficient.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Polygon Span]
  Group of (neighboring) px's within scan line.
\end{definition}

\begin{algorithm}[SC of Polygons]
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Calc all intersections on scan line
    \item Sort intersection points by ascending \(x\)-coordinate
    \item Fill all spans in between two consecutive intersections points if the parity is odd.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}
