# Cheatsheet Collection for BsC CS at ETHZ
This collection contains my summaries/cheatsheets throughout the bachelor's programme.

Summaries are created mostly with LaTeX, with the exception for coding intensive courses I prefer markdown. For completeness the repository even contains cheatsheets written by hand as some lectures required.
